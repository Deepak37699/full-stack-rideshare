## Troubleshooting

### If you get authentication errors:

1. Use Personal Access Token instead of password
2. Generate token at: GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
3. Use token as password when prompted

### If you get permission errors:

1. Check repository permissions
2. Ensure you're the owner or have write access
3. Verify remote URL is correct
